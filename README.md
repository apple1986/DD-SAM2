# DD-SAM2

## Please read the file in sam2\adapter_ap.py (https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2/blob/main/sam2/adapter_ap.py). There include our DD_Adapter.
## Please refer to train_xx.py, test_xx.py and save_seg_result_xx.py

Our code is based on SAM2 and MedSAM2. Please cite these two papers if it is helpful to you.
